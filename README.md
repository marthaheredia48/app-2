Second App - Kode with Klossy Mobile App Development Camp 2022
This project is my second iOS app created during the Kode with Klossy Mobile App Development Camp 2022. Building on the foundation of my first app, this project further explores the basic components of iOS app development in Xcode.

Features
Image Display: Just like in my first app, this one includes an image of coding on a computer, reinforcing the concept of integrating visual elements into an app.

"Click Me" Button: This app features a button labeled "Click Me," showcasing how to create interactive buttons that can engage users and trigger actions.

Text Display: A text label is used to display a message, continuing to demonstrate how text can be integrated and styled within an iOS app.

Purpose
The purpose of this app was to continue practicing and understanding the various UI components in Xcode. By changing the button label to "Click Me," I gained a deeper understanding of how to customize and interact with UI elements in iOS development.

Learning Experience
With this project, I built on the knowledge gained from my first app and learned how to:

Customize button labels and understand their properties.
Further explore Xcodeâ€™s interface and tools.
Enhance my skills in building simple, yet functional, mobile apps.
